# pi_in_monte_carlo
Calculating Ï€ by Monte-Carlo method enhanced with learning WPF and MVVM pattern.

MVVM responsibility.

View:
- drawing all generated points (for circle and for square)
- display calculated value of pi
- pass request to generate more points (1 or 10, depends on the button pressed)

ViewModel:
- calls "generate more points" method of model
- expose generated point lists and pi value to view

Model:
- generates random points
	- generates new point 
	- assign point to circle list and to square list (or rather points outside the circle list)
- calculates new pi value

Next step:
Attached Behaviour in WPF, resizing option.

Objectives:
 - Resize circle, square and recalculate points when windows size was changed.

View:
- pass request that window was resized (new r value)

ViewModel:
- calls "resize" method of model

Model:
- resize or better recalculates all points relative to new size od the window
	- recalculate resize factor with use of new and old r value
	- store new r value
